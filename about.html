    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">My interest in art began at a very young age when I entered Aunt Daisy's colouring-in competitions in the friday Stars newspaper. These competitions inspired me to persist in art during my youth, as prizes included iceblocks delivered directly to the house, tickets to shows, and book store vouchers.</p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">Before diving into a career path, I gained invaluable experience of cultural diversity in an extended OE, living and working in Europe and the Middle East. These experiences are still influencing my way of thinking and working today.      </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">On my return from overseas, I decided to study Graphic Design at the Auckland Institute of Technology, a practical and intensive course with inspirational tutors. After graduating, I returned to my home town of Christchurch and joined Top Marks Design as a Graphic Designer, where I worked for several years. Then, I transitioned to Global Culture, working as an Illustrator, Designer and Art Director.      </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">The next incredible adventure in life was raising three daughters while working part-time as a Marketing Communications Specialist for 16 years. This role involved team building, client and stakeholder engagement, updating social media platforms, plus detailed programming, coding, and development tasks for websites. It also included implementing and creatively developing corporate identity, advertising materials, illustrations and graphics. My success in this role is due to my strengths and skills in divergent thinking, creative problem-solving, thinking outside the box and paying attention to detail. </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">Years of creatively producing New Zealand and Māori marketing materials influenced my decision to enrol at the University of Canterbury to deepen my understanding of my homeland's history, culture, the Treaty of Waitangi and  Māori as tangata whēnua of Aotearoa. I was also inspired to enrol due to my growing concern for environmental, social justice and human rights issues. Having achieved outstanding results in Sociology, Human Services and Anthropology, I now look forward to combining and applying my academic and creative abilities to a new challenge. </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">I have also participated in voluntary work with kindergartens, schools, churches, Dog Watch, and ecological restoration programmes. My most recent voluntary role is with the Red Cross New Zealand as a Migrant Refugee Settlement Support Leader. </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">On a personal note, my interests include horticulture, sailing, travelling, gardening, environmental conservation, paddleboarding and yoga.    Furthermore, I am also a great believer that laughter cures a multitude of ills, so I love to include humour in my designs whenever possible. </p>
<p class="aboutparagraphtext">Personal Motto: Laugh, Love, Live, and be kind to others.  </p>

    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">At Digital Fusion we're very protective of our culture so the environment in which we work is a big focus for us. The Christchurch February earthquake, saw us fitting out a new office after we were evicted from our central city digs. We wanted our new office to be a reflection of Digital Fusion, it's people and what we value. When establishing the design we wanted to work with people who understood that, and Lorraine Borrmeister got on our wave length right away. </p>
<p class="aboutparagraphtext">We're unashamed Apple lovers, so there was always going to be lots of white and glass. We decided the glass needed a little something special. Lorraine had a tough brief. Whilst we wanted frosting on the glass, it had to maintain the view to outdoors and the airy spaciousness that glass affords. But we also needed to create privacy for the occupants of the rooms. We worked closely with Lorraine to create a personalised, unique design to adorn the floor to ceiling glass walls of our offices and meeting rooms. </p>
<p class="aboutparagraphtext">The end result surpassed our expectations - it's like having personal, original pieces of art throughout our office. We are thrilled.</p>

    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">When I decided to start my own business I had the concept in place but wasn't sure what direction I needed to take with logo &amp; website design.    In a few short conversations and emails Lorraine was able to deliver some fantastic ideas &amp; plans to bring my dream business to reality.  She had an abundance of ideas and worked with me to come up with a design we were both really happy with &amp; that totally matched my business type.    </p>
<p class="aboutparagraphtext">If you are looking for creativity, efficiency, &amp; industry knowledge have a chat with Lorraine as she was able to help me in a way that other designers couldn't.  Thank you Lorraine!    </p>

    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">One of the most important decisions a business owner has to make is to decide on an image that is going to graphically demontrate what their business represents.</p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext"> Lorraine led us through this minefield with ease.  She knows exactly what works, gave solid advice and gave us a professional, unique image that is not just for our business card - but  for all our signage and correspondance. </p>
    <p class="aboutparagraphtext">I can thoroughly recommend Lorraine and her designs as well as her helpful, friendly, personal approach.  </p>
